<h2 class="underlined-Hypothesis">Hypothesis</h2>
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #black; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
  Neighbourhoods with higher average income levels show higher levels of environmental engagement such as recycling or participation in green initiatives, compared to neighbourhoods with lower average income levels.

<h2 class="underlined-project-title">What the Project is About</h2>            
<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #black; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
  The purpose of this project is to investigate whether there is a relationship between the average income of a neighborhood and the level of environmental engagement in New york City. In order to accomplish this, I conducted research and created multiple visualizations, each of which focused on one specific aspect of the problem.
</p>
<h2 class="underlined-visualisation">Visualisation</h2>
<div class="thirdimage">

<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #black; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
 The first visualisation provides an overview of the amount of waste collected in tonnes by various environmental programs in New York City. According to the data, non-recyclable general garbage under the "refuse" (which stands for regular garbage) category makes up the majority of the waste that is collected. Pilot initiatives for organics collection, metal/glass/plastic recycling, and paper/cardboard recycling all have comparatively lower volumes. This implies that even though there is infrastructure for recycling, participation might be unequal.

  The next two maps cover neighborhood-specific environmental engagement. The first map provides a detailed view of the levels of participation in various NYC neighborhoods by displaying recycling and composting as a percentage of the total amount of garbage collected. Areas such as Queens show significantly higher levels of participation, as shown by the second, more detailed map that shows overall engagement rates by borough.

  <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #black; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
  Lastly, the scatter plot with trendlines shows how environmental engagement varies by income group based on the rates at which various recyclable materials are captured. The capture rates for aluminum, glass, metal, and paper all gradually rise as income rises from low to high. These trends suggest a strong and positive correlation between income level and proper recycling behavior.

  <h2 class="underlined-Hypothesis">Conclusion</h2>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #black; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
  Based on the data and visualizations presented, we can conclude that there is a clear and steady positive correlation between the income level of a neighborhood and its level of environmental engagement in New York City. Households with higher incomes are more likely to recycle and compost, among other sustainable practices. That being said it might be because they have better access to resources, education, and infrastructure, these households are more likely to properly sort their waste and participate in diversion programs. On the other hand, low-income communities might experience issues like limited access to services, incomplete information, and conflicting financial concerns, all of which can lower involvement in environmental actions.
